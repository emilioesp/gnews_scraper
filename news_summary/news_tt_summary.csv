We’re in constant discussions with all of the entities.” On whether T&T can manage the refugee/asylum situation right now, the AG said, “The math is, are we prepared from a policy perspective to manage this perspective right now, because once you turn that key, then you create rights and obligations which are actionable and then you have to be prepared to operationalise that law. “Most refugees remain for many years in their host country and make significant contributions to its development.

2019-01-28	1	IN a move announced last Friday, hesitant and tentative as it may have been, the Prime Minister’s statement on providing special identification cards for Venezuelan nationals in Trinidad and Tobago is a welcome step forward.

The report reveals details of complaints by asylum-seekers about having to pay a “security bond” as a condition of release from prison.” There have been questions about whether, in fact, some of those persons should have been detained in prison in the first place, as distinct from the Immigration Detention Centre.

2019-03-19	1	“No one can tell you with any level of certainty, how many legal or illegal Venezuelans are here so the first thing we need to do is have the registration exercise. Police have reported that some Venezuelans barter drugs and weapons for food or cash to purchase groceries.

2019-05-23	1	Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley said on Thursday this country cannot be a solution to millions of Venezuelan migrants fleeing their country due to economic hardship nor could T&T be converted into a refugee camp. “But as things got worse, more of them came and we kept our doors opened. “When people come here illegally,” Rowley said, “they could possibly remain which was not a healthy situation for us.” Rowley drew reference to the 101 Venezuelan migrants who were arrested on Wednesday by police during a crackdown in Palo Seco, Erin and Cedros.

2019-05-27	1	Another long-term measure she said was having language and educational programmes to be conducted by members of the Church and volunteers to help educate Venezuelans children who would not be initially integrated into the school system. When asked whether the Presbyterian schools will open its doors to migrants children, Abdul-Mohan said this was a decision to be discussed by the Presbyterian Primary School Board of Education as there are many legal certifications required for entry into schools. So that while they are with us we can assist them in understanding our language and we understand theirs so that they will not be taken advantage of…If they are going to be here for a year we need to teach them family life, education and treat with them in terms of language barriers and to encourage spirituality,” she said.

2019-05-30	3	Apart from our runaway crime rate, failing economy, endemic corruption and the fact that KFC’s bacon double down sandwich is a huge seller, some Trinidadians like my uncle Varun express an open contempt for Venezuelans. Last week I learned he spent all day abusing the new barman at Double R bar, saying “allyuh kind coming here to take my job”. Though when you consider Minister Khan does not seem to know what’s going on in the Ministry of Energy, that might actually be true. 
2019-06-02	1	SOME taxi-drivers decided to capitalise on the bad weather and the Venezuelan migrant registration and charge more than three times the fare to Achievors Banquet Hall in San Fernando yesterday.

2019-06-14	2	"""What I would say to people who see this as xenophobic is charity starts at home. The Commissioner cautioned against fear-mongering saying while there have been incidents of Venezuelan migrants involved in criminal activities, people ought not to target or profile Venezuelans as a whole. Today is the culmination of a two-week registration period in which Venezuelan migrants have been mandated by Government to declare their presence, in exchange for a special registration card and clearance to work for one year. "
2019-06-15	2	BY last Thursday, when that ugly big word, “xenophobia”, was falling from common mouths, about 14,000 Venezuelans had passed the government’s registration test, thereby qualifying for temporary if not permanent residence. By 2019, the Venezuelan invasion, improvised in short-order small boatloads, did not make landfall here as an inrush coming out of some unknown nowhere. It is competitive and very hard for us because we have to help out our families back in Venezuela,” Moya said.

Both Fingal and Ali said they believe an expansion of the labour force will augur well for this country’s competitiveness competence.

2019-07-24	1	Threatened with legal action by a group of 248 unregistered Venezuelan migrants, Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley has responded by digging in his heels and instructing his National Security Minister to deport all unregistered Venezuelans. Dr Rowley’s tough stance is consistent with his position on illegal Venezuelan immigrants. Despite Dr Rowley’s invoking of the spectre of refugee camps in Trinidad, Venezuelans who have been slipping into Trinidad show no interest in being marginalised into the camps. 
2019-07-27	1	Young said Immigration Division had to ensure that the information provided on the application forms was accurate with Interpol and other intelligence agencies, with some registrants failing this “due diligence” exercise. Holders of the cards will be granted an additional six months once successfully assessed. “But there are safeguards within this card that we can verify at any given point in time.” She said the cards will not allow Venezuelans to vote, become a citizen or grant them permanent residency but for them to work legally for six months in the first instance.

He was responding to objections from international and domestic critics to T&T’s repatriation of 82 Venezuelans. 
2019-08-16	1	The Attorney General has recently revealed that legislation which seeks to treat with asylum requests from foreign nationals is being prepared. While the Government’s action was certainly both heavy-handed and shortsighted; since it was not a solution which could be repeated indefinitely; to see the migrant problem simply in terms only of humanitarian concerns is itself short sighted. And genuine refugees or not this country had better find a modus operandi for dealing with them humanely but realistically given our circumstances. 
2019-08-20	1	The Guyana possibility apart, Trump’s new immigration rules should cause all Caribbean governments to consider how they cope with an increased population resulting from greatly restricted emigration. Even the present categories of workers that are allowed free movement within Caricom should be reviewed considering current developments. Caricom countries should collectively address the issue and determine how best they could jointly deal with it. 
2019-09-07	1	2019 will undoubtedly be known as the year when the ongoing political and economic crisis in Venezuela spilled onto our shores here in T&T. In a matter of two weeks (May 31-June 14) more than 14,000 Venezuelans registered to live and work in Trinidad and Tobago for one year.

Young responded yesterday to the Guardian Media saying: “As I have previously indicated, the Government, through the Ministry of National Security, has a very careful and cautious policy to deal with persons who claim to be citizens of Trinidad and Tobago located in ISIS conflict war zones. Perkins-Ferreira and two other women have 11 family members between them at the camps. 
2019-11-05	1	According to him, these women should not be labelled terrorists as they were just being “good Muslim wives” by following their husbands. I don’t buy the excuse that some of them were tricked into going to Syria. What guarantees do we have that they won’t return and spread it to other Muslims? 
2019-11-17	1	National Security Minister Stuart Young said on Sunday that information in the public domain about T&T nationals who left to join ISIS must first be verified but acknowledged that some of the evidence was disturbing.
